# ☕ Coffee Sales Dashboard  

A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze monthly coffee shop sales performance, order trends, and product demand patterns across multiple store locations.  



##  Purpose  

The **Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard** is an analytical Power BI solution created to help business owners, analysts, and managers explore and compare sales performance over time and across store locations.  
It provides insights into monthly growth, weekday vs. weekend trends, and store-level contributions to overall revenue — enabling data-driven decisions to optimize operations and sales strategies.



##  Business Problem  

Coffee shop managers often struggle to monitor sales performance across different outlets and time periods due to scattered or unstructured data. Without a centralized dashboard, it becomes difficult to identify monthly growth, peak hours, and product demand patterns.  

This dashboard provides a unified view of key performance metrics, helping decision-makers quickly understand sales trends, customer behavior, and store efficiency.
